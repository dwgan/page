For Smart Industrial, I am focusing on develop the ecosystem of smart home/industrial technologies using ST microchips.

As a System Application Engineer at ST, I specialize in smart industrial applications for smart homes, with a primary focus on advancing the ecosystem. One key area of our work is promoting the KNX standard, a leading international protocol in smart home automation that ensures seamless compatibility and plug-and-play functionality across devices. We’ve developed various demos to showcase the integration of ST’s products, such as STM32 MCU/MPU, chips, KNX protocol chips, IO-Link protocol chips, edge AI sensors, DC-DC converters, and energy harvesting chips. Our demos include smart charging stations, mini IoT houses, photovoltaic energy storage and harvesting, IoT sensors, KNX-based smart building management systems, and solutions for remote network monitoring and intranet penetration.
