This area is my major direction that I done at STMicroelectronics.

As a System Application Engineer at ST,  I am focusing on develop the solution for **smart industrial** area using ST product.

One key area we are recently focus on is **humaniod robot**. 

## Joint module

## Robotic hands

## Past work

In the past, we have develop a lot of solution for smart home, especially **KNX**. which is a leading international protocol in smart home automation that ensures seamless compatibility and plug-and-play functionality across devices. We’ve developed various demos to showcase the integration of ST’s products. During the development process of those demo solution, I get more familiar with ST products, such as STM32 MCU/MPU, chips, KNX protocol chips, IO-Link protocol chips, edge AI sensors, DC-DC converters, and energy harvesting chips. Our demos include smart charging stations, mini IoT houses, photovoltaic energy storage and harvesting, IoT sensors, KNX-based smart building management systems, and solutions for remote network monitoring and intranet penetration.
