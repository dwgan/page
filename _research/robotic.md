This is the major work I did at STMicroelectronics, which aims to promote new technologies based on the ST ecosystem.

As a System Application Engineer at ST, I focus on developing solutions for the **Smart Industrial** area using ST products.

One key area we have recently focused on is the **Humanoid Robot**.

## Past work

In the past, we have developed many solutions for smart homes, especially for **KNX**. Which is a leading international protocol in smart home automation that ensures seamless compatibility and plug-and-play functionality across devices. We’ve developed various demos to showcase the integration of ST’s products. During the development process of those demo solutions, I got more familiar with ST products, such as STM32 MCU/MPU, chips, KNX protocol chips, IO-Link protocol chips, edge AI sensors, DC-DC converters, and energy harvesting chips. Our demos include smart charging stations, mini IoT houses, photovoltaic energy storage and harvesting, IoT sensors, KNX-based smart building management systems, and solutions for remote network monitoring and intranet penetration.
