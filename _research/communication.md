## Intelligent Communication System for Aircraft

For Wireless Communication, I am focusing on develop the communication devices used for wireless data, instruction transmission inside the cabin of rocket.

Since 2020 to 2023, I was participated in some project that provided aerospace devices for Commercial Aerospace Company like [Beijing Skywalk Technology Co., Ltd.](http://www.spacetransportation.com.cn/) During this period, I was able to design high-reliable hardware and software for aerospace devices as well as solve some problem using wireless communication. I learned how to solve those hard problems in aerospace devices using a systems engineering mindset.

Aim to empowering the next generation of intelligent aircraft communication systems, we addresses challenges in the application of new technologies, leveraging existing industrial technologies for low-cost, rapid iteration of aircraft devices. My primary focus is on in-cabin wireless communication, wireless power transfer, and onboard central computer for rocket.

Utilizing ultra wide band (UWB) wireless communication technology, we solve some wireless communication challenges including high-rate transmission (camera data), time-sensitive transmission (synchronous data), high-reliable transmission (instruction data) and wireless networking (hard to realize by wire communication). We also solve problem of wireless power and proposed unified core communication framework for missile-borne computer.

All devices are verified through aerospace experiment and flight missions. Here is the [report link](https://www.guancha.cn/industry-science/2022_01_24_623388.shtml) about one of flight missions.
