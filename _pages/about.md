Hi there, wellcome to my homepage!

My name is **Dongwen Gan** (**甘东文**). I am recently a Application Engineer at [**STMicroelectronics**](https://www.st.com/) (Shenzhen), since Jun. 2023.

I received the Master degree from [**Xidian University**](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), China, in Jun. 2023. I spent a wonderful time working closely with Prof. Lei Quan  and Prof. Kai Xie at [GATE](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/XK3/zh_CN/index.htm) Lab. Previously, I received the B.E. degree from Xidian University, China, in Jun. 2020.

My recent research interests include **Deep Compressed Sensing**, **Edge AI**, **Smart Industrial** and **Wireless Communication**. Learn more about my [research](/research/).
